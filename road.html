                <p>The series is highly recommended by multiple authors and is an emotional rollercoaster. The series starts with Charles James having his nightmares which he eventually disregards. But then later on his life, he has to deal with death, hardship, and money struggels, which eventually lead him to question whether those nightmares about that particular road are true. The other two books in the series, "The Forgotten Road," and the latest one, "The Road Home," helps us go more into Charles' life and how he gets back up on his feet. This is a 10/10 recommended series from multiple critics for romance. </p>
