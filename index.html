                    <p>Richard Paul Evans became an author to inspire young children and teenagers to chase their dreams. His hit series, "Michael Vey," inspired many young students to follow their dreams. Just like Michael Vey, Richard also has Tourette's Syndrome. Michael Vey became a best selling series prompting Richard to go around various middle and high schools along with book stores to discuss his passion of writing and inspire others to do so. Seven of his books have become TV Shows such as most recently The Noel Diary and The Miseltoe Inn. His success has come from his motivation to inspire young readers and stemming from his childhood in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
